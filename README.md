# Image Classification CNN

# AIML421 Capstone Project

## Description

This project was developed during the 4th Year of my University Honours Degree. 

This project encompassed the knowledge learned during the AIML421 course, focused on Data Preparation and Machine Learning.

This specific Convolutional Neural Network was trained to idenfity the differences between Cherries, Tomatoes and Strawberries.

This project was developed in the Python programming language. The notable tools used were; *PyTorch* and *TensorFlow*.

## Process

The process undertaken for this project is underlined in the report attached to the repository. To summarise; An EDA was performed to determine the shortcomings of the dataset.

Images were evaluated based on expected shapes and limiting noise and were pruned from the dataset to ensure optimal training.

The final result of a CNN was compared against a Multi-Layer Perceptron trained for the same purpose and was compared within the Report.

## Results

The results of the Project indicated a strong learning ability for the CNN compared to the MLP. Training and Testing was done with seperate datasets.

Testing was done before submission by splitting the dataset 70/30 and evaulating recall and recognition on the trained CNN. Both skillsets performed well.

The CNN developed performed well on the final test set provided by course coordinators, receiving a 97% accuracy. Training time also sat within the range of 10-15 minutes.
